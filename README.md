## 📘 Story Points Overview  

## 📈 Story Point 1: EV Growth Over Time
EV adoption accelerated rapidly after 2017, reaching **37K vehicles in 2023** — nearly **6x higher** than in 2015.  
🚀 Growth was fueled by strong government incentives, rising fuel prices, and Tesla’s market leadership.  
📌 This surge shows EVs moving from niche to **mass-market adoption** in just a few years.  

---

## ⚡ Story Point 2: CAFV Eligibility
Nearly **2 in 3 EVs (62%)** qualify for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives.  
✅ Eligible vehicles are typically **newer models with longer ranges**.  
❌ About **37% remain ineligible**, often older or short-range models.  
📌 CAFV incentives highlight how policy design drives **consumer choice toward sustainable EVs**.  

---

## 🚘 Story Point 3: EV Model Distribution
EV adoption is concentrated in a few models:  
- **Tesla dominates** with Model 3, Model Y, and Model S leading registrations.  
- Nissan Leaf remains a strong budget-friendly option.  
📌 This concentration shows that **brand trust + charging network availability** play a big role in adoption.  

---

## 🌍 Story Point 4: Regional Trends
EV penetration is **highest in urban counties**, especially Seattle & King County.  
🏙️ Cities offer stronger charging infrastructure and supportive policies.  
🏞️ Rural counties lag due to limited infrastructure and higher upfront costs.  
📌 The regional gap shows the importance of **infrastructure expansion** for broad EV adoption.  

## 📈 Key Insights / Findings  

- 🚀 **EV adoption is accelerating** — registrations have grown sharply since 2017, reaching their peak in 2023.  
- ⚡ **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) dominate** over Plug-in Hybrid EVs (PHEVs), showing a market shift toward full electrification.  
- 🏆 **Tesla leads the U.S. EV market**, with Model 3 and Model Y driving most of the growth.  
- 🌍 **California remains the EV hub**, accounting for the highest adoption rates compared to all other states combined.  
- ✅ **Clean Vehicle Incentives matter** — around 62% of EVs are CAFV eligible, highlighting the role of government policies in driving adoption.  
- 📌 **Urban vs. Rural gap** — EV adoption is higher in cities with better charging infrastructure, while rural areas lag behind.  

## 🗂️ Data Source  

The dataset used in this project is publicly available from the **U.S. Department of Energy – Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC)**.
